# Exercise for Front-end Developers

## Statista React Search

Welcome to our programming exercise for Senior Front-end Developers.

Please build a React application that allows users to search for statistics using our Statista API. The application should meet the following requirements:

---

### Requirements

- A search bar that allows users to enter a query and see a list of matching statistics.
- A detail page for each statistic that displays additional information.
- A "favorites" feature that allows users to save statistics to a list for later viewing.
- A pagination feature that allows users to browse through the search results.
- Use react hooks, tailwind CSS, and react query to build the application.
- Bonus: use Typescript.
- Bonus: implement testing.

### Frame conditions

- Instead of the real Statista Search API use the following JSON file for the Ajax request:
  https://cdn.statcdn.com/static/application/search_results.json
- This sample data only contains search results for the keyword â€œStatistaâ€. This means the search functionality wouldn't work for other search terms, which is fine.
- The provided code is done on create-react-app, feel free to use any other tools, e.g, Next.

### Support

- You can use statista.com as a design reference. The linked stylesheets give you the opportunity to use the same utility classes as used on statista.com.
- API documentation:
  - https://de.statista.com/api/v2/doc
