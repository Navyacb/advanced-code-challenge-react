This graphic shows the total population of Austria: Cisleithania from 1818 until 1910, just before the outbreak of World War I. As we can see from the graph, the population grows rather gradually throughout this 92 year period. The only dip in population comes between 1846 and 1851, possibly as a result of the revolutions that took place in 1848. After this time the population continues to grow before reaching over 28.5 million people in 1910. \r\n \r\nThe later stages of the Austro-Hungarian Empire's history were marked by a period of internal tensions between the varying ethnic groups, as the ethnic Slavs, Czechs and Romance groups felt oppressed by the ruling Germanic and Magyar peoples. The Empire was then dissolved in 1918 following its defeat during the First World War, and a number of new states were formed in the aftermath.",
